# Cybersecurity Breach Cost Prediction

This project analyzes real-world cybersecurity breach data using machine learning models to predict the financial impact (high or low cost) of incidents. It includes:

✅ Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis  
✅ Implementation of Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers  
✅ Use of SHAP for explainable AI and model interpretation  
✅ Visualizations of feature importance and prediction explanations  

The project demonstrates how predictive models combined with explainability tools like SHAP can support better cybersecurity risk management decisions.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- SHAP  
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
